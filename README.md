# Android Jetpack Compose Assignment
### Overview
This project demonstrates the use of modern Android development practices with Jetpack Compose. The application showcases various features including pagination, dependency injection, image loading, and more.

### Features
- **Clean Architecture**: The project adheres to Clean Architecture principles for maintainable and scalable code.
- **MVVM Repository Pattern**: Implements the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with a repository layer for data management.
- **Hilt for Dependency Injection**: Utilizes Hilt for dependency injection to manage dependencies effectively.
- **Coil for Image Loading**: Uses Coil for efficient and flexible image loading.
- **Paging 3**: Implements Paging 3 for smooth pagination of large datasets.
- **Coroutines**: Handles background tasks using Kotlin Coroutines for better performance and responsiveness.
- **Retrofit**: Configured Retrofit for API service integration and data retrieval.
- **Navigation Component**: Integrates Jetpack Navigation Component to manage navigation and back-stack handling between composables efficiently.
